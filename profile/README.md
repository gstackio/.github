Hi!

Gstack is a French consultancy, specialized in several Cloud techs:

- Platforms: [Kubernetes][k8s] & [Cloud Foundry][cf].
- CI/CD: ‚úàÔ∏è [Concourse][concourse], [GitLab][gitlab], [GitHub Actions][gh_actions],
  üó°Ô∏è [Dagger][dagger].
- Cross-Cloud automation: [Bosh][bosh].

We contribute to Bosh souce code and documentation, being active member of the
[Foundational Infrastructure WG][fiwg], a [working groups][fiwg] of the Cloud
Foundry foundation.

Talks:

- [Authoring a BOSH Release Is Actually Easy!][bosh_release_authoring], a
  short walk-thru the whole process of authoring a Bosh release, to that the
  Bosh robot can handle your clusterd cloud workloads for you (it's a lighting
  talk!)
- [Project 42 - Making CI/CD a First Class Citizen in Cloud Foundry][prj42_long],
  presenting a project done for the hachathon (that we won!) at Cloud Foundry
  Summit in Philadelphia (also the short [submission talk][prj42_short])
- [Deploy like a Boss with BOSH][bosh_intro], an introduction to BOSH, that hs
  been the base of the Bosh trainings we've built and delivered later.

- Turbine ([CLI][turbine_cli]), a framework that helps structuring coordinated
  and modularized Bosh deployments, for managing a Cloud Foundry or Concourse
  platform.
- [Concourse Turbine][concourse_turbine], a Turbine project for deploying a
  top notch Concourse cluster, with full encryption.
